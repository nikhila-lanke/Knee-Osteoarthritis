# Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Classification from X-Rays using Deep Learning

**Abstract: **
Knee osteoarthritis is the predominant type
of arthritis, affecting joint tissues and afflicting millions
of individuals globally. At present, there are no medications
available to cure knee osteoarthritis. The only method to manage
the progression of this disease is through early detection. X-ray
imaging is currently a key method for predicting osteoarthritis.
However, the manual interpretation of X-rays is susceptible to
errors due to the limited expertise of radiologists. In recent
studies, automated systems employing machine learning have
been explored for their efficiency in predicting osteoarthritis
from X-ray images. However, the majority of these methods
must enhance their predictive accuracy to effectively detect
osteoarthritis in its early stages. X-ray images are usually graded
using Kellgren and Lawrenceâ€™s (KL) grading scheme according
to the order of severity of osteoarthritis from normal to severe.
This study aims to detect and classify knee osteoarthritis
according to the KL grading system for radiographs. The
proposed solution is an ensemble model which combines
the strength of the InceptionResNetV2 and Xception neural
network architectures. The ensemble model demonstrates high
performance, yielding an accuracy score of 95.1%. This work
contributes to the growing field of medical image analysis,
providing a reliable and effective tool for clinicians in the early
diagnosis and treatment planning of KOA.
